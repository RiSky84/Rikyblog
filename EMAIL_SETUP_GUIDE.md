# 📧 Contact Form Email Setup - Troubleshooting Guide

## � Current Issue: Email Sending Failed

Your contact form is configured with Formspree ID `meozgndw` but emails are failing to send. Here's how to fix it:

## ✅ Immediate Fixes to Try

### Step 1: Verify Formspree Form Status
1. Go to **[formspree.io/login](https://formspree.io/login)**
2. Log into your account (email: rikyrabha@gmail.com)
3. Check if form `meozgndw` is active and verified
4. Look for any error messages or quotas reached

### Step 2: Check Email Settings
Your current form configuration:
```html
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/meozgndw" method="POST">
```

**Possible Issues:**
- Form might need email verification
- Monthly submission limit reached (100 on free plan)
- Form might be paused or deactivated

### Step 3: Test Form Directly
1. Go to: `https://formspree.io/f/meozgndw`
2. This should show your form settings
3. If you get an error, the form ID is invalid

## 🛠️ Advanced Troubleshooting

### Check Browser Console
1. Press F12 to open developer tools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Submit the form and look for error messages
4. Common errors:
   - `403 Forbidden` = Form needs verification
   - `429 Too Many Requests` = Monthly limit reached
   - `404 Not Found` = Invalid form ID

### Alternative: Create New Form
If the current form is broken:
1. Go to **[formspree.io](https://formspree.io)**
2. Create a new form
3. Get the new form ID
4. Replace `meozgndw` with your new form ID

### Step 4: Update Your Code
Replace the current form action with new form ID:
```html
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_NEW_FORM_ID" method="POST">
```
   ```html
   <form class="contact-form" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
   ```
3. Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual ID:
   ```html
   <form class="contact-form" action="https://formspree.io/f/xeqydeyz" method="POST">
   ```

### Step 4: Deploy
1. Save the file
2. Run: `git add . && git commit -m "Enable real email for contact form" && git push`
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to update

### Step 5: Test
